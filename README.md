# SpiderVersePortal
Unity 2019.4.31f1 Project containing a shader test for a Spider-Verse Portal


Since it is using Unity Version 2019, as well as the Vanilla Unity Render pipeline,

It should be compatible with VRChat (But havent tested it out yet...).



You can download it as a Unity Package in the Latest Releases, or just pull down the repo for the whole project.

If you have any problems with it, then its likely that i dont know the fix either way lmao
